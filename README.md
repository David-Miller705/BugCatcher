# BugCatcher

This is an automated test suite of the website https://bugcatcher-jasdhir.coe.revaturelabs.com/?dev=5
written in Java using Selenium, Cucumber, and TestNG.

To run the test suite either:
1) Open the project in your IDE of choice and run the testNG.xml file
2) Use the command `mvn test` from the command line

Currently the website fails 6 tests and passes 21, and the defects are documented
in the "test\_documents" folder
